# Stan 4 Sustainability
Support your favorite celebrities? Save the Earth? COUNT US IN! Stan 4 Sustainability is a platform to help offset your favorite celebritiesâ€™ carbon footprint through YOUR own actions.

## Inspiration
We're a team of three women passionate about sustainability and making a positive impact on our planet. During Cal Hacks 11.0, we wanted to build something people would enjoy using, while also promoting behavior that's good for the environment-- like recycling, walking, and taking public transportation. We were inspired by the recent controversies surrounding excessive carbon footprints of celebrities, and we know the impact of huge fanbases coming together. We decided to connect the two to help fans make a real change by reducing their own carbon footprint.

## What it does
We created a webpage that allows users to visualize the CO2 emissions of celebrities by analyzing publicly accessibly flight data. Then, we allow users to input their own data by tracking steps, distance traveled through biking or taking public transportation, and even inputting product barcodes of recyclable items. We display progress bars showing each fanbase, and how close they are to reaching their goal.

## How we built it
We built our webpage using Javascript, Express.js, and Node.js for the backend, and React, Typescript, HTML/CSS for the frontend
